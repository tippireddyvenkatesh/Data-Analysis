# Week 1 â€“ Statistics & Basic Math

## âœ… Topics Covered
- Mean, Median, Mode
- Standard Deviation & Variance
- Normal Distribution
- Percentiles & Quartiles
- Probability Basics
- Basic Arithmetic
- Weighted Average
- Cumulative Sum

## ðŸ“˜ What I Learned
- How central tendency helps summarize data
- The importance of standard deviation in measuring spread
- What makes data "normally distributed" and why it matters
- How to use percentiles and quartiles to detect outliers
- The power of cumulative sum in trend analysis

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used
- Pen & paper for understanding math logic
- Excel (for calculating mean, median, SD)

## ðŸ§  Insights
- Standard Deviation is relative â€” you need context!
- Normal distribution is assumed in many models but doesn't apply to all datasets
- Probability basics are simple but extremely useful in real-world analytics
